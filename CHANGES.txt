CHANGES.txt for cc65_atar8bit_extended_headers
Bill Kendrick <bill@newbreedsoftware.com>

 * 2015-07-17: Initial fork into a github project.
   Based on changesets from my 'hiworld' project:
   * July 10, 2015
     - Added a few more page 0 & 2 locations regarding split-screen
       text windows & more.
     - Started working on os.h, which includes OS vectors/etc.
   * June 27, 2015
     - Renamed chip structures in extended_headers/ with "x"
       (e.g., __x_gtia_write() to avoid conflict with cc65's
     - Added "atascii.h" extended header, to give full ATASCII
       coverage, beyond what cc65 provides.
       - Also includes (a few; work-in-progress) string literals for each
         (so you can do, e.g., printf(CHS_CLR "Screen is now blank");)
     - Added internal keycodes (read from CH (0x2FC), aka PEEK(764))
       to pokey.h
   * May 31, 2015
     - Grabbed the Atari chip headers (_antic.h, _pokey.h, etc.) from
       cc65 (v2.14, git master as of 2015-05-30), and added stuff:
       * #defines to shadow registers (e.g., "COLOR0" for "COLPF0")
       * #defines of bits and other values used by various registers
         (e.g., CHACTL_INV_TRANS, etc. for CHACTL/CHACT)
     - Added headers containing useful page 0 and page 2 registers
       (excluding the shadow registers already included in the chip
       header files)
     - Moved sound functions into sound.c/sound.h
   * January 25, 2014
     - Added some sound-related routines
       - SOUND_INIT() - initialize
       - SOUND(chan, pitch, dist, vol) - play a 8-bit sound on one of 4 channels
       - DSOUND(chan, pitch, dist, vol) - play a 16-bit sound on one of 2 chans
